## Overview

### The challenge

Main view should:
- Show a list of Trending GIFs.
- Show a Navbar enable to toggle between two sources [giphy](https://giphy.com/) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/).
- Show a search bar so a user can find a GIF.
- A list of previous search terms should be maintained and should be clickable to re-run that search.
- Store the previous search history in the localstorage, so that it will be displayed in the history bar.

Users should be able to:
-  Search for a term. 
- After the user Searches for a term, app will display results of search right there in the main view
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
